                <h2>Horror Story Generator</h2>
                <p><b>Background:</b> I'm a huge fan of horror stories! I love listening to them on YouTube and reading them on Reddit. However, with the sheer number of stories out there, I started wondering - are they all written by humans, or are some generated by AI? That curiosity led me to an exciting project: I decided to crawl horror stories, fine-tune a model, and see if AI could craft terrifying tales of its own.</p>

                <p><b>Background:</b> This project was my final assignment for the Pattern Recognition course. It focused on detecting a person's mental or physical state using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. By analyzing brainwave patterns, the goal was to classify different states using machine learning techniques. The project involved preprocessing EEG signals, extracting meaningful features, and experimenting with various models.</p>

One day, a question crossed my mind: Could I determine a country's income classification based solely on its economic indices? To find out, I decided to collect a dataset and build a model to answer this question.</p>
